# description: PostgreSQL RDBMS

# This is an example of a start/stop script for SysV-style init, such
# as is used on Linux systems.  You should edit some of the variables
# and maybe the 'echo' commands.
#
# Place this file at /etc/init.d/postgresql (or
# /etc/rc.d/init.d/postgresql) and make symlinks to
#   /etc/rc.d/rc0.d/K02postgresql
#   /etc/rc.d/rc1.d/K02postgresql
#   /etc/rc.d/rc2.d/K02postgresql
#   /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S98postgresql
#   /etc/rc.d/rc4.d/S98postgresql
#   /etc/rc.d/rc5.d/S98postgresql
# Or, if you have chkconfig, simply:
# chkconfig --add postgresql
#
# Proper init scripts on Linux systems normally require setting lock
# and pid files under /var/run as well as reacting to network
# settings, so you should treat this with care.

# Installation prefix

# Who to run postgres as, usually "postgres".  (NOT "root")

# Where to keep a log file
PGLOG="$PGDATA/serverlog"

# It's often a good idea to protect the postmaster from being killed by the
# OOM killer (which will tend to preferentially kill the postmaster because
# of the way it accounts for shared memory).  To do that, uncomment these
# three lines:
#PG_OOM_ADJUST_FILE=/proc/self/oom_score_adj
#PG_MASTER_OOM_SCORE_ADJ=-1000
#PG_CHILD_OOM_SCORE_ADJ=0
# Older Linux kernels may not have /proc/self/oom_score_adj, but instead
# /proc/self/oom_adj, which works similarly except for having a different
# range of scores.  For such a system, uncomment these three lines instead:
#PG_OOM_ADJUST_FILE=/proc/self/oom_adj
#PG_MASTER_OOM_SCORE_ADJ=-17
#PG_CHILD_OOM_SCORE_ADJ=0
