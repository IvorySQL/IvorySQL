# IvorySQL Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as contributors, maintainers, and leaders of the IvorySQL project pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free and inclusive experience for everyone. We commit to fostering an open and welcoming environment for all participants, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Respecting differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- Being supportive of others' growth and learning
- Taking responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
- Inappropriate use of community platforms or tools
- Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behaviors

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing the standards of acceptable behavior. They have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

Project maintainers also have the responsibility to:
- Provide guidance and mentorship to new contributors
- Ensure that the project remains accessible to contributors of all skill levels
- Address conflicts in a fair and transparent manner
- Lead by example in upholding these standards in all community venues

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including the project repository, discussions, issue trackers, community calls, and social media channels. It also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces. Examples of representing our project include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project team at [coc@ivorysql.org]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

Enforcement responsibilities are delegated to project leaders who will determine the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct. If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the project leaders may take any action they deem appropriate, including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning.

## Reporting Process

1. Contact the project team through the designated email address
2. Include a description of the incident, relevant links or screenshots, and any additional context that may be helpful
3. The report will be acknowledged within 48 hours
4. The team will investigate the incident and determine appropriate actions
5. The reporter will receive a follow-up communication regarding the outcome

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security concerns of the reporter of any incident.
