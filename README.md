![IvorySQL](https://github.com/IvorySQL/Ivory-www/blob/main/static/img/IvorySQL-black.png?raw=true)

IvorySQL is advanced, fully featured, open source Oracle compatible PostgreSQL with a firm commitment to always remain 100% compatible and a Drop-in replacement of the latest PostgreSQL. IvorySQL adds a “compatible_db” toggle switch to switch between Oracle and PostgreSQL compatibility modes.
One of the highlights of IvorySQL is PL/iSQL procedural language that supports oracle’s PL/SQL syntax and Oracle style Packages.

IvorySQL has imported and enhanced the [Orafce](https://github.com/orafce/orafce) extension to add support
for numerous Oracle compatibility features including built-in PACKAGES, data types, and conversion functions

The IvorySQL project is released under the Apache 2 license and encourages all types of contributions. For IvorySQL community no contribution is too small, and we want to thank all our community contributors.
