test_regex is a module for testing the regular expression package.
It is mostly meant to allow us to absorb Tcl's regex test suite.
Therefore, there are provisions to exercise regex features that
aren't currently exposed at the SQL level by PostgreSQL.

For more detailed instructions, refer to the "README" file in the "src/test/modules/test_regex" directory.
