test_bloomfilter overview
=========================

test_bloomfilter is a test harness module for testing Bloom filter library set
membership operations.  It consists of a single SQL-callable function,
test_bloomfilter(), plus a regression test that calls test_bloomfilter().
Membership tests are performed against a dataset that the test harness module
generates.

For more detailed instructions, refer to the "README" file in the "src/test/modules/test_bloomfilter" directory.
