src/oracle_test/authentication/README

Regression tests for authentication
===================================

This directory contains a test suite for authentication. SSL certificate
authentication tests are kept separate, in src/oracle_test/ssl/, because they
are more complicated, and are not safe to run in a multi-user system.

For more detailed instructions, refer to the "README" file in the "src/test/authentication" directory.
