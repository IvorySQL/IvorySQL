SSL regression tests
====================

This directory contains a test suite for SSL support. It tests both
client-side functionality, i.e. verifying server certificates, and
server-side functionality, i.e. certificate authorization.

For more detailed instructions, refer to the "README" file in the "src/test/ssl" directory.
