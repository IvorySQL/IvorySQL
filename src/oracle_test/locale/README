Locales
=======

This directory contains a set of tests for locales.  I provided one C
program test-ctype.c to test CTYPE support in libc and the installed
locale data.  Then there are test-sort.pl and test-sort.py that test
collating.

For more detailed instructions, refer to the "README" file in the "src/test/locale" directory.
