Isolation tests
===============

This directory contains a set of tests for concurrent behaviors in
IvorySQL-2.0.  These tests require running multiple interacting transactions,
which requires management of multiple concurrent connections, and therefore
can't be tested using the normal pg_regress program.  The name "isolation"
comes from the fact that the original motivation was to test the
serializable isolation level; but tests for other sorts of concurrent
behaviors have been added as well.

For more detailed instructions, refer to the "README" file in the "src/test/isolation" directory.
