Isolation tests
===============

This directory contains a set of tests for concurrent behaviors in
IvorySQL.  These tests require running multiple interacting transactions,
which requires management of multiple concurrent connections, and therefore
can't be tested using the normal pg_regress program.  The name "isolation"
comes from the fact that the original motivation was to test the
serializable isolation level; but tests for other sorts of concurrent
behaviors have been added as well.

For more detailed instructions, refer to the "README" file in the "src/test/isolation" directory.
