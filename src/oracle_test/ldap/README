Tests for LDAP functionality
============================

This directory contains a test suite for LDAP functionality.  This
requires a full OpenLDAP installation, including server and client
tools, and is therefore kept separate and not run by default.  You
might need to adjust some paths in the test file to have it find
OpenLDAP in a place that hadn't been thought of yet.

For more detailed instructions, refer to the "README" file in the "src/test/ldap" directory.
