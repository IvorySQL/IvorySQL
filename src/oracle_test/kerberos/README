Tests for Kerberos/GSSAPI functionality
=======================================

This directory contains a test suite for Kerberos/GSSAPI
functionality.  This requires a full MIT Kerberos installation,
including server and client tools, and is therefore kept separate and
not run by default.

For more detailed instructions, refer to the "README" file in the "src/test/kerberos" directory.
