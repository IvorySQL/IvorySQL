 *	  Block reference tables.
 *
 * A block reference table is used to keep track of which blocks have
 * been modified by WAL records within a certain LSN range.
 *
 * For each relation fork, we keep track of all blocks that have appeared
 * in block reference in the WAL. We also keep track of the "limit block",
 * which is the smallest relation length in blocks known to have occurred
 * during that range of WAL records.  This should be set to 0 if the relation
 * fork is created or destroyed, and to the post-truncation length if
 * truncated.
 *
 * Whenever we set the limit block, we also forget about any modified blocks
 * beyond that point. Those blocks don't exist any more. Such blocks can
 * later be marked as modified again; if that happens, it means the relation
 * was re-extended.

 * we divide the relation into chunks of 2^16 blocks and choose between
 * an array representation and a bitmap representation for each chunk.
 *
 * When the number of modified blocks in a given chunk is small, we
 * essentially store an array of block numbers, but we need not store the

 * to a bitmap representation.
 *
 * These same basic representational choices are used both when a block
 * reference table is stored in memory and when it is serialized to disk.

 * In the in-memory representation, we initially allocate each chunk with
 * space for a number of entries given by INITIAL_ENTRIES_PER_CHUNK and
 * increase that as necessary until we reach MAX_ENTRIES_PER_CHUNK.
