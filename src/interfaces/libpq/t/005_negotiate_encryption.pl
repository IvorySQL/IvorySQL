# OVERVIEW
# --------
#
# Test negotiation of SSL and GSSAPI encryption
#
# We test all combinations of:
#
# - all the libpq client options that affect the protocol negotiations
#   (gssencmode, sslmode, sslnegotiation)
# - server accepting or rejecting the authentication due to
#   pg_hba.conf entries
# - SSL and GSS enabled/disabled in the server
#
# That's a lot of combinations, so we use a table-driven approach.
# Each combination is represented by a line in a table. The line lists
# the options specifying the test case, and an expected outcome. The
# expected outcome includes whether the connection succeeds or fails,
# and whether it uses SSL, GSS or no encryption. It also includes a
# condensed trace of what steps were taken during the negotiation.
# That can catch cases like useless retries, or if the encryption
# methods are attempted in wrong order, even when it doesn't affect
# the final outcome.
#
# TEST TABLE FORMAT
# -----------------
#
# Example of the test table format:
#
# # USER     GSSENCMODE  SSLMODE    EVENTS                     -> OUTCOME
# testuser   disable     allow      connect, authok            -> plain
# .          .           prefer     connect, sslaccept, authok -> ssl
# testuser   require     *          connect, gssreject         -> fail
#
# USER, GSSENCMODE and SSLMODE fields are the libpq 'user',
# 'gssencmode' and 'sslmode' options used in the test. As a shorthand,
# a single dot ('.') can be used in the USER, GSSENCMODE, and SSLMODE
# fields, to indicate "same as on previous line". A '*' can be used
# as a wildcard; it is expanded to mean all possible values of that
# field.
#
# The EVENTS field is a condensed trace of expected steps during the
# negotiation:
#
#  connect:   a TCP connection was established
#  reconnect: TCP connection was disconnected, and a new one was established
#  sslaccept: client requested SSL encryption and server accepted it
#  sslreject: client requested SSL encryption but server rejected it
#  gssaccept: client requested GSSAPI encryption and server accepted it
#  gssreject: client requested GSSAPI encryption but server rejected it
#  authok:    client sent startup packet and authentication was performed successfully
#  authfail:  client sent startup packet but server rejected the authentication
#
# The event trace can be used to verify that the client negotiated the
# connection properly in more detail than just by looking at the
# outcome. For example, if the client opens spurious extra TCP
# connections, that would show up in the EVENTS.
#
# The OUTCOME field indicates the expected result of the test:
#
#  plain:     an unencrypted connection was established
#  ssl:       SSL connection was established
#  gss:       GSSAPI encrypted connection was established
#  fail:      the connection attempt failed
#
# Empty lines are ignored. '#' can be used to mark the rest of the
# line as a comment.
