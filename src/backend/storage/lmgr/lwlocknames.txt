# Some commonly-used locks have predefined positions within MainLWLockArray;
# these are defined here.  If you add a lock, add it to the end to avoid
# renumbering the existing locks; if you remove a lock, consider leaving a gap
# in the numbering sequence for the benefit of DTrace and other external
# debugging scripts.  Also, do not forget to update the section
# WaitEventLWLock of src/backend/utils/activity/wait_event_names.txt.
