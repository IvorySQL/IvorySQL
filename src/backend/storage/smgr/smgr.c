/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * smgr.c
 *	  public interface routines to storage manager switch.
 *
 * All file system operations on relations dispatch through these routines.
 * An SMgrRelation represents physical on-disk relation files that are open
 * for reading and writing.
 *
 * When a relation is first accessed through the relation cache, the
 * corresponding SMgrRelation entry is opened by calling smgropen(), and the
 * reference is stored in the relation cache entry.
 *
 * Accesses that don't go through the relation cache open the SMgrRelation
 * directly.  That includes flushing buffers from the buffer cache, as well as
 * all accesses in auxiliary processes like the checkpointer or the WAL redo
 * in the startup process.
 *
 * Operations like CREATE, DROP, ALTER TABLE also hold SMgrRelation references
 * independent of the relation cache.  They need to prepare the physical files
 * before updating the relation cache.
 *
 * There is a hash table that holds all the SMgrRelation entries in the
 * backend.  If you call smgropen() twice for the same rel locator, you get a
 * reference to the same SMgrRelation. The reference is valid until the end of
 * transaction.  This makes repeated access to the same relation efficient,
 * and allows caching things like the relation size in the SMgrRelation entry.
 *
 * At end of transaction, all SMgrRelation entries that haven't been pinned
 * are removed.  An SMgrRelation can hold kernel file system descriptors for
 * the underlying files, and we'd like to close those reasonably soon if the
 * file gets deleted.  The SMgrRelations references held by the relcache are
 * pinned to prevent them from being closed.
 *
 * There is another mechanism to close file descriptors early:
 * PROCSIGNAL_BARRIER_SMGRRELEASE.  It is a request to immediately close all
 * file descriptors.  Upon receiving that signal, the backend closes all file
 * descriptors held open by SMgrRelations, but because it can happen in the
 * middle of a transaction, we cannot destroy the SMgrRelation objects
 * themselves, as there could pointers to them in active use.  See
 * smgrrelease() and smgrreleaseall().

 * indexes).  Instead of incrementally WAL-logging the index build
 * steps, we can just write completed index pages to disk with smgrwrite
 * or smgrextend, and then fsync the completed index file before
 * committing the transaction.  (This is sufficient for purposes of
 * crash recovery, since it effectively duplicates forcing a checkpoint
 * for the completed index.  But it is *not* sufficient if one wishes
 * to use the WAL log for PITR or replication purposes: in that case
 * we have to make WAL entries as well.)
 *
 * The preceding writes should specify skipFsync = true to avoid
 * duplicative fsyncs.
 *
 * Note that you need to do FlushRelationBuffers() first if there is
 * any possibility that there are dirty buffers for the relation;
 * otherwise the sync is not very meaningful.
 *
 * Most callers should use the bulk loading facility in bulk_write.c
 * instead of calling this directly.
