 * read_stream.c
 *	  Mechanism for accessing buffered relation data with look-ahead
 *
 * Code that needs to access relation data typically pins blocks one at a
 * time, often in a predictable order that might be sequential or data-driven.
 * Calling the simple ReadBuffer() function for each block is inefficient,
 * because blocks that are not yet in the buffer pool require I/O operations
 * that are small and might stall waiting for storage.  This mechanism looks
 * into the future and calls StartReadBuffers() and WaitReadBuffers() to read
 * neighboring blocks together and ahead of time, with an adaptive look-ahead
 * distance.
 *
 * A user-provided callback generates a stream of block numbers that is used
 * to form reads of up to io_combine_limit, by attempting to merge them with a
 * pending read.  When that isn't possible, the existing pending read is sent
 * to StartReadBuffers() so that a new one can begin to form.
 *
 * The algorithm for controlling the look-ahead distance tries to classify the
 * stream into three ideal behaviors:
 *
 * A) No I/O is necessary, because the requested blocks are fully cached
 * already.  There is no benefit to looking ahead more than one block, so
 * distance is 1.  This is the default initial assumption.
 *
 * B) I/O is necessary, but read-ahead advice is undesirable because the
 * access is sequential and we can rely on the kernel's read-ahead heuristics,
 * or impossible because direct I/O is enabled, or the system doesn't support
 * read-ahead advice.  There is no benefit in looking ahead more than
 * io_combine_limit, because in this case the only goal is larger read system
 * calls.  Looking further ahead would pin many buffers and perform
 * speculative work for no benefit.
 *
 * C) I/O is necessary, it appears to be random, and this system supports
 * read-ahead advice.  We'll look further ahead in order to reach the
 * configured level of I/O concurrency.
 *
 * The distance increases rapidly and decays slowly, so that it moves towards
 * those levels as different I/O patterns are discovered.  For example, a
 * sequential scan of fully cached data doesn't bother looking ahead, but a
 * sequential scan that hits a region of uncached blocks will start issuing
 * increasingly wide read calls until it plateaus at io_combine_limit.
 *
 * The main data structure is a circular queue of buffers of size
 * max_pinned_buffers plus some extra space for technical reasons, ready to be
 * returned by read_stream_next_buffer().  Each buffer also has an optional
 * variable sized object that is passed from the callback to the consumer of
 * buffers.
 *
 * Parallel to the queue of buffers, there is a circular queue of in-progress
 * I/Os that have been started with StartReadBuffers(), and for which
 * WaitReadBuffers() must be called before returning the buffer.
 *
 * For example, if the callback returns block numbers 10, 42, 43, 44, 60 in
 * successive calls, then these data structures might appear as follows:
 *
 *                          buffers buf/data       ios
 *
 *                          +----+  +-----+       +--------+
 *                          |    |  |     |  +----+ 42..44 | <- oldest_io_index
 *                          +----+  +-----+  |    +--------+
 *   oldest_buffer_index -> | 10 |  |  ?  |  | +--+ 60..60 |
 *                          +----+  +-----+  | |  +--------+
 *                          | 42 |  |  ?  |<-+ |  |        | <- next_io_index
 *                          +----+  +-----+    |  +--------+
 *                          | 43 |  |  ?  |    |  |        |
 *                          +----+  +-----+    |  +--------+
 *                          | 44 |  |  ?  |    |  |        |
 *                          +----+  +-----+    |  +--------+
 *                          | 60 |  |  ?  |<---+
 *                          +----+  +-----+
 *     next_buffer_index -> |    |  |     |
 *                          +----+  +-----+
 *
 * In the example, 5 buffers are pinned, and the next buffer to be streamed to
 * the client is block 10.  Block 10 was a hit and has no associated I/O, but
 * the range 42..44 requires an I/O wait before its buffers are returned, as
 * does block 60.
