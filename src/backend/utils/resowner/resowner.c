/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * resowner.c
 *	  POSTGRES resource owner management code.
 *
 * Query-lifespan resources are tracked by associating them with
 * ResourceOwner objects.  This provides a simple mechanism for ensuring
 * that such resources are freed at the right time.
 * See utils/resowner/README for more info on how to use it.
 *
 * The implementation consists of a small fixed-size array and a hash table.
 * New entries are inserted to the fixed-size array, and when the array
 * fills up, all the entries are moved to the hash table.  This way, the
 * array always contains a few most recently remembered references.  To find
 * a particular reference, you need to search both the array and the hash
 * table.
 *
 * The most frequent usage is that a resource is remembered, and forgotten
 * shortly thereafter.  For example, pin a buffer, read one tuple from it,
 * release the pin.  Linearly scanning the small array handles that case
 * efficiently.  However, some resources are held for a longer time, and
 * sometimes a lot of resources need to be held simultaneously.  The hash
 * table handles those cases.
 *
 * When it's time to release the resources, we sort them according to the
 * release-priority of each resource, and release them in that order.
 *
 * Local lock references are special, they are not stored in the array or
 * the hash table.  Instead, each resource owner has a separate small cache
 * of locks it owns.  The lock manager has the same information in its local
 * lock hash table, and we fall back on that if the cache overflows, but
 * traversing the hash table is slower when there are a lot of locks
 * belonging to other resource owners.  This is to speed up bulk releasing
 * or reassigning locks from a resource owner to its parent.
