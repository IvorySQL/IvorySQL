# Copyright (c) 2023, PostgreSQL Global Development Group

# This list serves as the basis for generating source and documentation files
# related to wait events.
#
# The files generated from this one are:
#
#   src/backend/utils/activity/wait_event_types.h
#      typedef enum definitions for wait events.
#
#   src/backend/utils/activity/pgstat_wait_event.c
#      C functions to get the wait event name based on the enum.
#
#   src/backend/utils/activity/wait_event_types.sgml
#      SGML tables of wait events for inclusion in the documentation.
#
# This file defines one wait event per line, with the following
# tab-separated fields:
#
#   "C symbol in enums" "format in the system views" "description in the docs"
#
# When adding a new wait event, make sure it is placed in the appropriate
# ClassName section.
#
# WaitEventLWLock and WaitEventLock have their own C code for their wait event
# enums and function names.  Hence, for these, only the SGML documentation is
# generated.
#
# This file is fed to src/backend/utils/activity/generate-wait_event_types.pl.
