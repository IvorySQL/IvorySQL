 * Maximum accepted size of GSS and SSPI authentication tokens.
 * We also use this as a limit on ordinary password packet lengths.
 *
 * Kerberos tickets are usually quite small, but the TGTs issued by Windows
 * domain controllers include an authorization field known as the Privilege
 * Attribute Certificate (PAC), which contains the user's Windows permissions
 * (group memberships etc.). The PAC is copied into all tickets obtained on
 * the basis of this TGT (even those issued by Unix realms which the Windows
 * realm trusts), and can be several kB in size. The maximum token size
 * accepted by Windows systems is determined by the MaxAuthToken Windows
 * registry setting. Microsoft recommends that it is not set higher than
 * 65535 bytes, so that seems like a reasonable limit for us as well.
