 * Create a astreamer that can edit recoverydata into an archive stream.
 *
 * The input should be a series of typed chunks (not ASTREAMER_UNKNOWN) as
 * per the conventions described in astreamer.h; the chunks forwarded to
 * the next astreamer will be similarly typed, but the
 * ASTREAMER_MEMBER_HEADER chunks may be zero-length in cases where we've
 * edited the archive stream.
 *
 * Our goal is to do one of the following three things with the content passed
 * via recoveryconfcontents: (1) if is_recovery_guc_supported is false, then
 * put the content into recovery.conf, replacing any existing archive member
 * by that name; (2) if is_recovery_guc_supported is true and
 * postgresql.auto.conf exists in the archive, then append the content
 * provided to the existing file; and (3) if is_recovery_guc_supported is
 * true but postgresql.auto.conf does not exist in the archive, then create
 * it with the specified content.
 *
 * In addition, if is_recovery_guc_supported is true, then we create a
 * zero-length standby.signal file, dropping any file with that name from
 * the archive.
