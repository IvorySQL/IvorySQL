-- This test checks that lookup_type_cache() can correctly handle an
-- interruption.  We use the injection point to simulate an error but note
-- that a similar situation could happen due to user query interruption.
-- Despite the interruption, a map entry from the relation oid to type cache
-- entry should be created.  This is validated by subsequent modification of
-- the table schema, then type casts which use new schema implying
-- successful type cache invalidation by relation oid.
