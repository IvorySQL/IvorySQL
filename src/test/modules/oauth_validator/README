Test programs and libraries for OAuth
-------------------------------------

This folder contains tests for the client- and server-side OAuth
implementations. Most tests are run end-to-end to test both simultaneously. The
tests in t/001_server use a mock OAuth authorization server, implemented jointly
by t/OAuth/Server.pm and t/oauth_server.py, to run the libpq Device
Authorization flow. The tests in t/002_client exercise custom OAuth flows and
don't need an authorization server.

Tests in this folder require 'oauth' to be present in PG_TEST_EXTRA, since
HTTPS servers listening on localhost with TCP/IP sockets will be started. A
Python installation is required to run the mock authorization server.
