# Detach after wait and wakeup.
# Permutations like the following one commented out should be avoided, as
# the detach may finish before the SQL function doing the wait returns
# its result.  It is recommended to use wakeups as the last permutation
# should a wait be done within an SQL function.
#permutation wait1 wakeup2 detach2

# Detach before wakeup.  s1 waits until wakeup, ignores the detach.
permutation wait1 detach2 wakeup2

# Detach before wait does not cause a wait, wakeup produces an error.
